# Monty Hall Simulator
Simulator for the Monty Hall problem in the form of a React web app!

## Frontend
The frontend was built using React, and was generated using create-react-app. It also uses MaterialUI.

## Backend
The backend was written in node, and handles all of the application logic. Tests were written using Jest.

## How do I try it out?
Well, first of all, clone the repository, then:
```
cd api
npm install
cd ..
cd client
npm install
```
After that, you can start both the frontend and backend:
```
cd api
npm start
```
and
```
cd client
npm start
```
### For testing:
Tests are available for the backend, while in the api root folder, simply run:
```
npm run tests
```
